## Instructions

You are require to build a single page application that allows user to add text and image into canvas. Below are the basic requirements for the application:

- user can *upload image* to images list
- user can *add, edit and remove image and text* to the canvas

_Note: the canvas element type is plain HTML `<div>`, not `<canvas>`_

You will be given a HTML file with simple structure, and a server that allows you to upload and retrieve image. Instruction on how to run the server is included below.

Kindly showcase your best design pattern of JS structure that is easy to understand for team collaboration. You are encouraged to use only pure JavaScript. If your design pattern needed a library, you are allow to do so given a good reason. Try finishing this test in **one day** and send it back to us. If you are not able to finish, do send us whatever you have done, we will evaluate accordingly.

**Primary task**
- app should works as the specification required
- code and flow should be properly documented
- code present good structure, design pattern and modular

**Bonus**
- code written in functional and reactive way
- build automated test for the app
- JS code is loaded using module dependency library such as RequireJS, CommonJS or Webpack

Please zipped your working folder with the name `<your name>-piktojstest`. The folder should contains everything we sent you, plus whatever file(s) you created. In addition, you could provide a `readme` to describe your design pattern or anything you wish to let us know. Have fun programming ðŸ˜Š


## To set up the environment dependencies ( node version 5++ )
```
$ npm install
```

## To run the node server

```
$ npm run start
```

Server is listening to port `8000`

## Instruction on file upload

## routes

#### get uploaded images
```
/images
```

#### upload image to server
```
/uploads
```

Note that name of the file input has to be `upload` as this is what the server will be reading from


The server only accepts `png` and `jpeg` file format
